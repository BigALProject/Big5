# Overview
This project is for SEIS 764 - Artificial Intelligence.

The goal of the project is to use satelite images pre and post natural disaster to automatically classify the damage done to a structure.

we took the images from https://xview2.org/dataset and pre-processed them by applying a mask to the images to isolate the houses.
Then we fed those images into a variety of AI algorithms including CNN, VG16, Graph, and Google.

General process (see user manual):
- Download bulk images from https://xview2.org/dataset
- Transform images by using mask and filtering out each house.
- Pass images into AI.
