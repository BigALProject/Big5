## Data
All data will go into data/ directory, which is NOT in the repository. 
Since the original dataset is too large to check it,

## Python third party libraries
the file requirements.txt contains the libraries required to run the processes.
Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all libraries.

## Each model has it's own directory.

<p>We have taking the raw data and connnected the houses via 
               a graph based on lattitude and longitude and distance between houses.  
               We then ferd that data into the Google Tensorflow library to produce a 
               model for predicting the damage.</P
