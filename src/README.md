## Data
<p>All data will go into data/ directory, which is NOT in the repository. 
Since the original dataset is too large (12GB) to add to teh repo,
you must downlaod it yourself.</p>

            - <p>We extracted the raw goelocaiton data form the dataset and generated a 
               graph based on lattitude and longitude and distance between houses.  
               We then ferd that data into the Google Tensorflow library to produce a 
               model for predicting the damage.</p>
